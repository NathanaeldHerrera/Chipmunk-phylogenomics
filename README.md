# Crater Chipmunk Phylogenomics
Pipeline describing data processesing and analysis pipelines/scripts used in Herrera et al. (submitted) "Phylogenomic, morphometric, and environmental niche resolution of chipmunk species limits with extensive hybridization". This repository outlines raw read processing through variant discovery, phylogenetic analysis of western chipmunks for both ddRAD-Seq and whole genome sequence data. Here, we performed enivirnmental nich modeling, analysis of bacular morphology (a key reproductive morphological trait), species tree inference, estimate hybridization with species network inference, and summary statistics (D-statistics; QuIBL).

In each section bellow, I describe the pipeline used in a markdown file (follow links below) and have tried to provide as much annotation as possible. Scripts referenced in each section can be found inside the respective folders.
